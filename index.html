Hello, this is Yushi Li and Xiang Li's XR project1.（Unreal 5, Blueprints, JIRA, etc)  
Unreal 5: 
Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) is a state-of-the-art game engine from Epic Games, offering revolutionary graphics and real-time rendering capabilities. Its key features, Nanite and Lumen, enable highly detailed environments and dynamic lighting, enhancing game development and interactive experiences across platforms. UE5 empowers creators with unprecedented visual fidelity and scalability.
Blueprint: Blueprint is a visual scripting system within Unreal Engine, allowing developers to create game logic and interactive content without writing traditional code. It uses a node-based interface for designing behaviors and interactions, making game development more accessible to non-programmers while offering robust capabilities for complex projects, enhancing productivity and creativity.
JIRA: Jira, developed by Atlassian, is a versatile project management tool for tracking and managing tasks across various projects. It supports agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban, enabling teams to prioritize work, monitor progress, and collaborate effectively. Ideal for bug tracking and issue management, Jira is essential for enhancing team productivity and project visibility.

</ul>
Hello, this is Yushi Li and Xiang Li's XR project2.（Unity, JIRA, etc)  
Unity: Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc.'s Worldwide Developers Conference. It's a powerful and flexible platform used for the development of both 2D and 3D games and interactive experiences.
JIRA: Jira, developed by Atlassian, is a versatile project management tool for tracking and managing tasks across various projects. It supports agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban, enabling teams to prioritize work, monitor progress, and collaborate effectively. Ideal for bug tracking and issue management, Jira is essential for enhancing team productivity and project visibility.

<li><a href="https://youtu.be/XM_FSnYkfbs">EECS 498-007 Game Engine Custom Feature</a></li>
</ul>
In this project, I developed a 2D game engine using C++ along with several libraries such as GLM, RapidJSON, LuaBridge, SDL, and Box2D, among others. The engine allows users to script their own games using Lua. Additionally, I incorporated custom features that enable support for multiple controller inputs.
